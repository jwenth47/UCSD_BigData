It is a climatic region typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. **Mediterranean climates** labeled as **CSa/CSb** is very different, warm summer and mild winters but relatively dry, like San Diego.\n",
